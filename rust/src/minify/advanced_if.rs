// If statement optimisation:
// - `if (a) { b }`            => `a && b`             if `b` can be reduced to a single expression.
// - `if (a) { b } else { c }` => `a ? b : c`          if `b` and `c` can be reduced to a single expression.
// - `if (a) { b; return c }`  => `if (a) return b, c` if `b` can be reduced to a single expression.
// The last form is more for normalisation: it doesn't minify much by itself (it still remains a statement), but allows a containing `if` to optimise `if (a) { b; return c } d; return e` into `return a ? (b, c) : (d, e)` if `b` and `d` can be reduced to a single expression. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to minify the containing `if`.
// Note that it's not possible for both branches to return, as a previous pass should have already unwrapped the unnecessary block. We also normalise it such that if only `else` returns, it's flipped, and then the `else` can be unwrapped.
//
// Expected normalisations before performing this optimisation:
// - Removing as many non-expression statements as possible:
//   - Removing EmptyStmt and DebuggerStmt nodes.
//   - Hoisting as many VarDecl nodes as possible (or even removing them if unused or optimised away e.g. lexical lifetimes).
//   - Removing empty IfStmt and TryStmt nodes.
//   - Dropping dead code.
//   - Unwrapping unnecessary BlockStmt nodes.
//   - Performing this advanced IfStmt optimisation (yes, this optimisation recursively depends on itself).
// - Normalising IfStmt such that either no branch returns or the consequent branch returns and there is no `else`.
//
// We only perform advanced statement analysis and transformation to expression in `if` and `else` blocks as that will allow opportunities to transform `if` into logical expressions. This isn't useful elsewhere, as a sequence of expression statements is the same size as a sequence of expressions separated by commas, so the fact it's an expression is not being leveraged.
